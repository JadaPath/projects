    The first cookies are thought to be test cakes bakers used to test the oven temperature.
    Cookies appear to have their origins in 7th century AD Persia, shortly after the use of sugar became relatively common in the region. They spread to Europe through the Muslim 
    conquest of Spain. By the 14th century, they were common in all levels of society throughout Europe, from royal cuisine to street vendors.

     The Dutch called their handheld confections "koekjes," which is derived from the word for cake: "koek." By the 1700s, when New Amsterdam became New York, 
     the word became Anglicized the word into "cookie" or "cookey."
