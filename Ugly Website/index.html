<p><B>CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES</B></p>
<p><B>what you'll need:</B></p>
<ul>
<li>1 large egg</li>
<li>1/2 cup butter butter</li>
<li>1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
<li>1 3/4 cup flour</li>
<li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
<li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
</ul>

For this recipe, you’re going to start by melting the butter. The butter shouldn’t be sizzling hot. If you’re not sure how hot is too hot, you’ll want it about 90% melted, and then you’ll whisk it until it finishes melting.
<br>
<br>
Once the butter has melted, whisk in the sugars until well-combined. Mix in the vanilla extract and egg.
<br>
<br>
Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir in just until combined. You don’t want to overmix the dough.
<br>
<br>
Stir in the chocolate chips, and then scoop the dough. Place about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet.
<br>
<br>
Bake until the cookies are set on the edges but slightly underdone in the middle, about 7-10 minutes.
